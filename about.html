      I am a 22 year old guy from Long Beach, CA. I used to be a computer engineer student at Cal Poly, SLO; unfortunately, I had to put my studies on hiatus for a myriad of reasons. What followed next was a short-lived military career in the U.S. Air Force as an aircraft electrician. The reason was medical, but the commander was nice enough to grant me a full honorable discharge. Although I would have liked to finish my contract, it was also a blessing. I worked at a Japanese-owned, European-inspired bakery literally down the street from the physical location of the San Francisco devBootcamp campus. As of 22 July 2016, I no longer am employed there... or anywhere. I am waiting until devBootcamp starts kicking gears, so I won't lose my mind. I am really excited to get through this and start taking control of my life.
